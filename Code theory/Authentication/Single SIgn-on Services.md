# Single SIgn-on Services

User logs in with a single set of credentials to access several related, but independent systems. 

E.g.: Google. You log in to Google, and have acccess to Youtube, Google, Gmail....


Pros:
- Better User Experience
- Less passwords
- Do not have to save all passwords for the separated sites
- A user can be deactivated in one place for all sites

Cons:
- Credential is much more valuable, access for multiple resources
- When you use the facebook account for multiple sites, and you want to give up your Facebook account, ....well, you can not, or you have to create a new account with different credentials for the other service. 
- The authentications are visible to the primary SSO source/service.
