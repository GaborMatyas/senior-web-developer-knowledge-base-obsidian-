# Dynamic Programming

"A method for solving a complex problem by breaking it down into a collection of simpler subproblems, solving each of those subproblems just once, and storing their solutions."

## The problems wher you should use this programming style:
- A problem is said to have **overlapping subproblems** if it can be broken down into subproblems which are reused several times. (Fibonnaci numbers)
- A problem is said to have **optimal substructure** if an optimal solution can be constructed from optimal solutions of its subproblems

Solutions: 
- [[Tabulation]]
- [[Memoization]]
