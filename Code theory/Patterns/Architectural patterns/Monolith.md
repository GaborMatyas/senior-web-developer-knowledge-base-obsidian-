# Monolith


A single application that consists of a single executable(e.g.: an exe file) but it is deployed as a whole. It can contain additional components (e.g.: jpg, dll files...).
It includes everything that needs to solve an intended problem, and when a new feature is requested, it is implemented inside this application.
