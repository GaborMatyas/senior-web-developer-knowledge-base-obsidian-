# Interfaces


An interface defines the methods an object must have in order to be considered a particular type. 
The interface is an abstract type that specifies a behvior that classes must implement.
Interfaces allow different classes to share similarities.
Not all classes need to have the same behviour.

The intergaces does not work well in some cases because they supply no implementation and destroy code reuse.
