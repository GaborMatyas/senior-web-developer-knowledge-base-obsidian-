The cyclomatic complexity of a section of [source code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code "Source code") is the number of [linearly independent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linearly_independent "Linearly independent") [paths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_(graph_theory) "Path (graph theory)") within itâ€”a set of paths being linearly dependent if there is a subset of one or more paths where the [symmetric difference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_difference "Symmetric difference") of their edge sets is empty. 

For instance, if the source code contained `NO` [control flow statements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_flow "Control flow") (conditionals or decision points), the complexity would be 1, since there would be only a single path through the code. If the code had one single-condition IF statement, there would be two paths through the code: one where the IF statement evaluates to TRUE and another one where it evaluates to FALSE, so the complexity would be 2. Two nested single-condition IFs, or one IF with two conditions, would produce a complexity of 3.

You compute it by using the control flow graph of the program. Cyclomatic complexity **measures the number of nested conditions within the code**, such as those created by for, if/else, switch, while, and until. The greater the number of conditions, the greater the complexity
