# Tree traversals

## Visit every node once
The Breadth First and Depth First is the same regarding time complexity, because we are visiting every node once. 

If the tree is not so deep as wide, the breadth first approach consums less memory (recursion), so the space complexity is smaller with this one. And if the tree is wider than its depth, the depth first will consum more space.
