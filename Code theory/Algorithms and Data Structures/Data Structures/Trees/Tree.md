# Tree Data Structure

A data structure that consists of nodes in a parent / child relationship. 
Each node can have more than one reference to other nodes. 

[[Data Structures#Lists|Lists]] are linear. 

Trees are nonlinear.

## Terminology
- **Root**: the top node in a tree. 
- **Child**: a node directly connected to another node when moving away from the Root.
- **Parent**: The converse notion of a child. 
- **Siblings**: A group of nodes with the same parent. 
- **Leaf**: A node without children. 
- **Edge**: The connection between one node and another.
