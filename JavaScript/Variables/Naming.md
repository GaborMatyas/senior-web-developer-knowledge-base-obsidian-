# Naming
JavaScript is case sensitive.  
Only letters and digits can be used as a variable name. 
Special characters are allowed: `_` and `$`

### Invalid names
`21Players` - can not start with a number
`user-b` - special characters are not allowed besides `_` and `$`
`let, const, etc...` - reserved keywords can not be used like:
```js
	const const = 334;
```

## Forms
#### Best Practice:
camelCase

#### Alternatives:
snake_case - allowed but bad practice
kebab-case - allowed but bad practice
