# Arithmetic operators

[Remainder](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Remainder) (`%`)
Binary operator. Returns the integer remainder of dividing the two operands.
12 % 5 returns 2.


[Increment](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Increment) (`++`)
Unary operator. Adds one to its operand. If used as a prefix operator (`++x`), returns the value of its operand after adding one; if used as a postfix operator (`x++`), returns the value of its operand before adding one.
If `x` is 3, then `++x` sets `x` to 4 and returns 4, 
whereas `x++` returns 3 and, only then, sets `x` to 4.


[Decrement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Decrement) (`--`)
Unary operator. Subtracts one from its operand. The return value is analogous to that for the increment operator.
If `x` is 3, then `--x` sets `x` to 2 and returns 2, 
whereas `x--` returns 3 and, only then, sets `x` to 2.


[Unary negation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Unary_negation) (`-`)
Unary operator. Returns the negation of its operand.
If `x` is 3, then `-x` returns -3.


[Unary plus](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Unary_plus) (`+`)
Unary operator. Attempts to convert the operand to a number, if it is not already.
`+"3"` returns `3`.
`+true` returns `1`.
`+'haha'` return `NaN`

[Exponentiation operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Exponentiation) (`**`)
Calculates the `base` to the `exponent` power, that is, `base^exponent`
`2 ** 3` returns `8`.
`10 ** -1` returns `0.1`.
