# Dynamic programming language
It is not a pre-compiled language. The compilation happens on the fly. 
(For example the C language is a pre-compiled language because the compilation happens befor the execution, preferably during the development phase.)

So the code can change at runtime, that means a type of a variable can change during the execution. First it can store a string, and a number later.
