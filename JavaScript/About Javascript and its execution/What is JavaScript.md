## ECMAScript
EcmaScript is the actual language which is evolved by the ECMA International organisation and it is under active development. It is the standard but it is NOT used directly. Instead the language is implemented based on this standard by browser vendors, and this is what we call JavaScript. Although this is the most famous ECMAScript implementation, there are others like ActionScript or Jscript. 

## Characteristics
JavaScript is a [[dynamic]], [[weakly typed programming language]] which is compiled at runtime. It was invented originaly to change the content dynamically on a webpage.  

It is interpreted, so it is compiled "on the fly".

"Hosted language", that means it runs in different environments. Like [[browser-side]] or [[server-side]].  

It is single thread language.
